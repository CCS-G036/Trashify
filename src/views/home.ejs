                        By adopting a waste bank management system, we can streamline the use of resources such as
                        manpower, materials, and finances, making waste management processes more efficient and
                        effective.
                        <br><br>
                        This system facilitates the organized collection, sorting, and recycling of waste materials,
                        ensuring that recyclable items are properly processed and reintegrated into the production
                        cycle, fostering sustainability and reducing environmental impact.

                        Furthermore, it enables enhanced tracking and monitoring of waste generation and disposal
                        patterns, helping to pinpoint opportunities for waste reduction and optimize resource

                        By leveraging a data-driven approach, we can maximize resource efficiency, minimize waste, and
